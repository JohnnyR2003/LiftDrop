This diagram illustrates the typical order journey from a user's perspective, covering both successful and failed outcomes. It captures the interactions between clients, couriers, and the platform across different stages: order placement, courier acceptance, delivery progress, and resolution in case of errors or cancellations. The flow ensures that edge cases—such as order rejection or delivery failure—are considered during system design.
