\section*{Abstract}

The expansion of the \textbf{gig economy} has opened new opportunities for flexible, on-demand urban logistics, particularly in the food and package delivery sectors. This evolving landscape presents a need for modern, efficient, and transparent technological solutions that support both couriers and clients.

\textbf{LiftDrop} is a mobile application that aims to improve the delivery experience through intelligent order assignment that considers both courier performance and proximity to the pickup location. The system also supports seamless order cancellation for couriers and smart order placement for clientsâ€”automatically selecting the nearest branch of a restaurant chain if none is specified. Real-time courier tracking and efficient communication channels are integrated to ensure a responsive and reliable experience for all users.

The backend of the system is implemented in Kotlin using the Spring Boot framework, offering a modular and scalable architecture. PostgreSQL is used for managing structured relational data, while Jetpack Compose is employed for building the Android user interface, enabling a modern and reactive mobile experience.

This project explores the design and implementation of a delivery platform that emphasizes performance, usability, and trust, presenting an alternative approach to managing urban deliveries within the context of the gig economy.
