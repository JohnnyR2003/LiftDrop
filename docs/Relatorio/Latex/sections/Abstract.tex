\section*{Abstract}

The rise of the \textbf{gig economy} has significantly transformed industries like food and package delivery. This model, based on flexible short-term work facilitated by digital platforms, is used by companies such as Uber Eats, Glovo, and Bolt Food to enable on-demand urban logistics.

\bigskip

While these platforms offer convenience to customers, they often impose high commission fees on couriers, lack job stability, and introduce logistical inefficiencies. This creates a growing tension between platform profitability and worker welfare, while also affecting service reliability for customers.

\bigskip

\textbf{LiftDrop} addresses these issues by introducing a mobile app that promotes fairness, efficiency, and transparency. It aims to optimize delivery routes, reduce platform fees, and ensure better conditions for couriersâ€”ultimately improving the overall delivery experience for both workers and users.
