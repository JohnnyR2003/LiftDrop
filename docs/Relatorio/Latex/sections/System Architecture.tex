\subsection{System Architecture and Data Model}

This section presents multiple architectural views of the LiftDrop platform, highlighting how its components interact and how its data model is structured. Each diagram focuses on a different conceptual layer of the system, from user roles and sessions to request fulfillment and geolocation modeling.

\subsubsection{High-Level System Architecture}

Figure~\ref{fig:high-level-Overview} shows the overall system architecture. It illustrates the interaction between the Android mobile application and backend services responsible for order assignment, real-time messaging, authentication, and location tracking.

\subsubsection{User and Role Hierarchy}

This diagram illustrates how the abstract \texttt{User} entity is specialized into the \texttt{Client} and \texttt{Courier} roles. It also shows how sessions are managed on a per-user basis for secure authentication.

\subsubsection{Request and Delivery Lifecycle}

This model depicts the lifecycle of a delivery—from creation of a request by a client, through courier assignment, to delivery completion and rating. It reflects how entities such as \texttt{Request}, \texttt{Delivery}, and \texttt{CourierRating} are interlinked throughout the delivery flow.

\subsubsection{Location and Address Modeling}

This view focuses on how real-world geographic data is modeled within the platform. It shows the relationship between generalized \texttt{Location} entities and their specializations—\texttt{PickupSpot} and \texttt{DropOffSpot}—as well as how these relate to physical addresses.
