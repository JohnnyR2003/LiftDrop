\section{Introduction}
The gig economy has revolutionized delivery services, but existing platforms often prioritize customer convenience over courier well-being. LiftDrop addresses this gap by proposing a fairer, more efficient mobile app for deliveries.

\textbf{Key Goals:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimize order assignment using real-time data (proximity, traffic, fairness)
    \item Enhance courier safety with neighborhood ratings and alerts
    \item Streamline operations via a scalable Android app backed by two APIs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Courier API} (order management, real-time updates via SSE)
        \item \textbf{Client Simulation API} (mock orders for testing)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
