\section{Limitations and Future Work}

While LiftDrop successfully demonstrates the core mechanics of real-time courier assignment, delivery tracking, and state-driven UI logic, some features were intentionally left out due to time constraints. This section outlines key areas where the system could be expanded or improved in future iterations.

\subsection{Future Improvements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Client Application Interface}: The current system includes a simulated client API for testing, but no dedicated client-facing mobile application was developed.

    \item \textbf{WebSocket Reconnection Support}: The WebSocket implementation currently lacks fault-tolerance mechanisms for automatic reconnection in case of network disruptions. This may affect delivery request communication stability on unreliable connections.
    
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Earnings Model}: Extend the current earnings calculation to include compensation for time spent waiting at pickup locations, in addition to distance and item value.

     \item \textbf{Internationalization (i18n)}: Support for multiple languages to improve accessibility and usability for international users.
\end{itemize}
