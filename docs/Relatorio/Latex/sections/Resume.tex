\section {Resume} 

The rise of the \textbf{gig economy} has transformed various industries, particularly the food and package delivery sector. This economic model relies on flexible short-term work arrangements, often facilitated through digital platforms. Companies such as Uber Eats, Glovo, and Bolt Food have leveraged this framework to revolutionize urban logistics, enabling customers to order food and services on demand while offering couriers independent work opportunities.

Although these platforms prioritize customer convenience, they also present significant challenges for couriers. High commission fees, lack of job stability, and inefficiencies in delivery logistics create an imbalance between platform profitability and worker sustainability. In addition, customers often experience delays and inconsistent service quality.

To address these challenges, LiftDrop proposes a new approach to the gig economy by offering a more fair, efficient, and transparent delivery solution. This mobile app aims to improve courier conditions while enhancing the customer experience through optimized delivery processes and fairer economic policies.
