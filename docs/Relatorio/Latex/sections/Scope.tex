\section{Scope}

This section defines the functional and technical boundaries of the LiftDrop platform. It outlines the key features available to users, clients, and couriers, along with the strategies employed for real-time data communication, order assignment, and safety. These boundaries establish what the system is designed to accomplish, while also clarifying what lies outside the project's current scope.

\subsection{Platform Features}

\subsubsection{User Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Register as either a client or a courier.
    \item Clients provide personal and contact information during registration.
    \item Couriers specify their transportation method upon registration.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Client Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Place orders by selecting restaurants and desired items.
    \item Track order status and view estimated time of arrival.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Courier Features}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accept or decline delivery requests.
    \item Set availability by entering or exiting “waiting” status.
    \item Update the delivery status or cancel an accepted order.
    \item Confirm order delivery upon completion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Real-Time Communication Strategy}

Managing real-time data updates and courier interactions is central to the platform’s success. Three communication models were considered:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Polling (Request-Response):} Simple but inefficient, creating excessive network overhead.
    \item \textbf{Server-Sent Events (SSE):} Efficient for unidirectional updates, but limited in interaction complexity.
    \item \textbf{WebSockets:} Enables full-duplex communication and minimizes latency.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{WebSockets} were selected for their ability to support real-time bidirectional updates, crucial for dynamic interactions like order assignment, courier status changes, and live notifications.

\subsection{Order Assignment Strategy}

Orders are assigned based on multiple criteria to ensure fairness and efficiency:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Proximity:} Couriers closest to the pickup location are prioritized.
    \item \textbf{Fairness:} Distribution considers past assignments to avoid overload.
    \item \textbf{Traffic Conditions:} Live data helps optimize delivery time.
\end{itemize}

For geospatial data and route optimization, the system integrates the \textbf{Google Maps API}, leveraging its routing, distance calculation, and traffic-aware services.

\subsection{Courier Safety Measures}

To support safe working conditions for couriers, the platform includes weather alerts. Those alerts are made with the use of SSE (Server Side Events) to pass that information to the courier.
