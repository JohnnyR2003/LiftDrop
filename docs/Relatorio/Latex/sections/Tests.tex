\subsection{Tests}

The LiftDrop platform was tested through both manual and automated approaches to ensure correctness, reliability, and performance. Testing focused on backend behavior, including API functionality, business logic, and role-based access control.

\subsubsection{Manual Tests}

Manual tests were primarily used to verify API behavior and end-to-end interactions between clients and couriers. These tests were executed using \textbf{Postman}, allowing us to simulate real HTTP requests and observe responses in real time.

Key scenarios tested manually included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User registration and authentication
    \item Order creation and assignment
    \item Role-based access restrictions
    \item Session persistence via cookies
    \item Order cancellation and reassignment
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Automated Tests}

Automatic tests were written using the \textbf{JUnit} testing framework to validate the backendâ€™s core business logic. These tests were executed during development to catch regressions and verify key modules in isolation.

Test coverage included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit tests for repositories and services
    \item Validation of order assignment logic
    \item Verification of courier scoring algorithms
    \item Authentication and authorization checks
\end{itemize}

In future iterations, these tests can be extended with integration and UI testing using tools like Espresso or Retrofit mock services.
